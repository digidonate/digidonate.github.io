Charity and Aid payments can be difficult to track and can often get lost in the administrative journey across borders to where it is needed.

Q. How can charities receive funds via crypto currently?
    BitGive foundation uses GiveTrack solution to list worthy charity projects.
Q. Are Charities cross-checked through any other information databases?
    Kompany.com integration offers a DLT system for cross reference
Q. Do funds get released automatically, or is there a target window?
    Funds are collected on behalf of the cause until the target amount is reached.
Q. How can Ripple’s DLT enhance the process for handling charity donations?
    Using fast transaction time and low fees, it will help ensure low costs.
Q. How can existing tech solutions be used to enable the best fit?
    Even Foundation has a testnet for cross-chain transactions (CIP) and smart contracts.

Expand upon existing NGO protocols by applying smart contracts for creating a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) with refined Quality Management methods to deliver greatly improved emergency aid delivery, accountability and transparency.

By utilising the systems above, each donation will facilitate cross-border smart-contract payments directly to the charity projects, who will itemise expenses for on-site staff, the support group and any costs towards improving the local infrastructure network.

Target launch sector: Charity donations/emergency aid to refugee camps

Target Goals:     Cryptocurrency Donations, Charity Connection & Networking, Expense         Traceability, Quality Improvement, Community engagement, Smart Contract         management, Scalable System, Digital ID compatible

DigiDonate: Charity Donations

An existing/new charity/person-in-need decides they want to be part of the blockchain/on our platform —>  they register their cause/project on our platform (if already on blockchain: just integrate, if not on blockchain: set them up/verify)—> we set up automated smart contracts generator—> on our website[donors: log in, create profile, select cause/zone of interest, add token/connect their crypto wallet. Receiver: log in, create profile, state details of need/cause,wait for and receive donations while advertising on SM (w/custom URL)—> smart contract will eventually integrate with other IoTs/blockchains 

Application:
DigiDonate - a decentralized, international, multi-coin platform where people and organizations can request aid and donors can give any amount in any token.  Firstly, an existing/new charity/person-in-need will sign up to our platform (if they are not currently on the blockchain, they will be integrated upon sign-up). With our smart contract generator, each person/organization fills out a form with basic questions about their cause, and a smart contract is automatically created. On our website, donors can log in, create profiles, select their cause/zone of interest, and connect any cryptocurrency wallet to start donating. On the other hand, receivers can do the same and receive a custom URL for their cause while using social media to garner more attention. In the future, our smart contracts will eventually integrate with other IoT and blockchains and payment rails (ie. banking apps). Unlike a similar company BitGive, we work with individuals as well as charities, we accept all cryptocurrencies, and are international/decentralized with DAO principles in action and development.


*smart contract form: fill out currency, funds release date, min/max budget to get started, 3 trusted advocates/references

*differentiators (from BitGive)
DAO (not just portal) 
Multi coin (not just bitcoin)
De-centralized
Not US based

Next steps
contact the camp organizers and encourage them to offer one charity partner to work with: perhaps founders from here  https://obakkifoundation.org/about-us
Map possible basic and complex interactions that can be improved with smart contract and DLT.  Consider the macro and micro token and financial transactions that will be occurring.
Consider the range of options, Choose a prototype design, Find the technological layers required to implement, Sketch final idea with outlook to develop, Develop, Test and Publish.

Social Media: Aside being run on an app rather than on web, it makes use of social media platforms to reach a targeted audience.
Be able to donate to current projects funded by organizations or current refugees projects (pop-ups)
